it's a human dimention era, what's we can do to the creative and innovative human being for next? that's a big question. Now, technology has changed the way of thinking, ways of learning and the meaning of education, from the teachers as the focus of teaching learning process into teachers as mere facilitators. also now, successful learning is measured by the student’s individual ability to apply the models of learning and to use appropriate tools and information given by teacher to solve the problem they face in teaching learning process. if you're agreed, I offer you a future class looks a like :D
1. as a mere fasilitator, teacher must have a remarkable instructional for teaching as a trigger for students. include (brainstorming, explanation, task and feedback) (need an improve :D)
2. Technological support.I wondering, there will be a flexible and tech-friendly class where the whiteboard as a moving screen that is located not only in front of the class, but also on the right, left, and behind the students like the wall. With technological sophistication in the future (show's on youtube),it is very possible happen especially on subjects that require groups. so the student can see what happen on the screen from all direction. (also need improve :D)
3. evaluation. The last point that I offer you is an evaluation. evaluation should not be stiff at all (remain: at all) in order for students that can bring out theor creativity and ideas then teachers will need an instrument for that.
just like completing a mission in a game, there is always an achievement when we reach the target that given by and there is always a bonus if we do it better. (really need an improvement :D)
is that all guys.

Nowadays, we all must know that the improvement of technology is growing rapidly and of course bring many changes to the worlds' culture. Rapid development of technology is indeed bring a lot of positive influence for humans in all over the world.
Some positive effects of the development of technology as follows:
1. Exchange of information is going on very quickly.
2. Facilitate human work.
3. Work becomes more effective and efficient, etc
Here is my idea about future classroom model ;
The future of teachers and students in this high technological era is no longer limited by the time and classrooms that are in the educational setting but teachers and students are already connected to a network of computers and the Net. Back to home and if the students want to consult with the teacher they can do via Net. Schools can even establish virtual classrooms for students to solve their problems or to explore different lessons that interest them. Teachers and students from different classes and levels can join the discussion in this virtual classroom. Learning becomes infinite in space and time. Distance learning and teaching via the Internet can be done effectively so that students go to school giving the possibility of not only gaining knowledge and socialization process that can not be obtained in learning via the internet. Computers can not take on all school functions but in the dissemination of information technology, it can shift from centralized, shared learning to individualized, decentralized learning. - ]","2017-09-25 13:12:59"

"Co-design activity 1_Group 2","Co-design activity 1_Group 2","6","[ - Hallo Icha, Here's the specific design of my idea;
I actually offer virtual environment with collaborative object. I use 'Learning Circle' concept for this kind of design.
[ - 'Learning circles' is type projects combine distance learning with traditional learning being perceived as a complex of human networks requiring adequate technical, human, financial and procedural management (Brown, 1993).
'Learning circles' promote projects based activities on a given Topic incorporating them into curriculum.- ]
[ -- The classroom model by using “Learning Circles' model, consist of teachers (Depends on class) that together with students in their school carry out activities in the topic of interest to the group. (the process will descbribe latter)
The concept of 'learning circle' involves both school and local community. One can refer to it as a virtual classroom because once formed the group is working together for a period of 4-5 months based on a curriculum established in relation to the selected topic.
At the end of the activity, the group publishes their work product using some provided media (facebook, etc.)
Such materials can be educational materials for other teachers and students who did not participate in the project. Each session at the start of a new 'learning circle' will form a new virtual classroom. The major advantage of the activity in this type of project is that both students and teachers acquire new experiences.
It can be said that activities allow members of the local community as well (scientists, artists, etc.) to participate in projects by utilizing the provide media.","2017-09-26 10:04:03"

that has defined learning outcomes. Generally, game-based learning is designed to balance subject matter with gameplay and the ability of the player to retain, and apply said subject matter to the real world.Asystematic review (Link->https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review)

"Co-design activity1_ Group 1","Co-design activity1_ Group 1","2","The role of technology will mainly play as an important role in future classroom together with updated pedagogy. Multimedia’ function will take part as the key connection of learning and sharing with having great quality images, audio and video. While technological development sharply raises, traditional classroom design, strongly approach on text and teacher center approach becomes less motivation for learners. Moreover, to update pedagogy is getting as a strong requirement to match with technological development and high multimedia context.
Technology will create future classroom worldwide that does not need to exit at a particular classroom like being in present time with university/college classrooms. Even in current, university students spend most time in the lab rather than learning in the classroom. Classroom is only place where offer information and guiding how to approach what students want to study. Instructors leads the class by using technology supporting mainly. Thus, it is not deniable that technology will support learners to create their own classroom and learners can learn anytime and anywhere. Online classroom such as Massive Open Online Courses well known MOOC offers different kinds of courses; language, Science, Mathematics and so on, and it is getting popular among those who cannot spend the whole day and cost much. They can do distance learning and micro learning as well and can access free to join Smart classroom, I-classroom and video lectures of learning websites. Some video lectures for micro learning take only three minute for the information what they need to apply at work place. To get a particular skill in any field, the practical work should be more and longer than learning time, so, online learning fulfills such appropriate quality of their job.
In 21<sup>st</sup> century, young generations are quiet familiar with technology even though old generation leg far behind teach movement and still trying to catch up with this unique development. Together with enabling teach, educationist need to update pedagogy to hit the point of the society’s needs. Future classroom will be different at all with traditional classroom of 20<sup>th</sup> century and the present, the first decade of 21<sup>st</sup> century. Pedagogy should be related with the real problem in the world, so it is a need to support problem solving, innovative project for fair development, collaborative skill, consensus view and how to work together even though learner can learn individually. Individual learning fulfills for personal interesting and need, however, no one can solve the problem alone. Thus, the expectation of pedagogy for future classroom is high, actually how to work together, how to build human behavior better to love in living multi-culture and how to create positive environment to produce more humane beings.
Multimedia context is high even in present, so it will be the highest in near future when the whole world is a classroom. All the information by multi-media is mixing and missing, so the learner need to pick up what they want to learn and how should be approached. The role of instructor who has high tech skill will be an important role for how to use secure and safe in sharing to others and taking data from the others. Critical thinking to analyze information which are right or wrong, reasonable or unreasonable and how to response is very important to create networking society in advance for human value and standard","2017-10-03 14:27:01"
